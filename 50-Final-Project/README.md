# Final Project

This section provides a final project to apply all the concepts learned in the course.

## Project Description

Create a Bash script that automates the following tasks:

1. Monitors system performance and logs CPU, memory, and disk usage.
2. Archives and compresses log files older than 7 days.
3. Sends an email alert if disk usage exceeds 90%.
4. Interacts with a cloud API to upload the compressed logs.

## Requirements

- Use functions to organize the script.
- Handle errors gracefully.
- Use advanced file handling and networking techniques.

## Example Output

```bash
$ ./final_project.sh
Monitoring system performance...
Archiving old logs...
Uploading logs to cloud storage...
Email alert sent: Disk usage at 92%
```
